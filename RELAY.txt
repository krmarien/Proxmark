# Relay Attack

This code is based on the official Proxmark3 code.
But a lot of Verilog code (in de fpga directory) was removed and replaced by code for a relay attack.

Updated:
- all code in fpga/
- added commands to armsrc/iso14443a.c
- added armsrc/relay.c
- updated armsrc/appmain.c and armsrc/apps.h
- added commands to include/usb_cmd.h
- added commands to client/cmdhf14a.c
- added commands to client/cmdmain.c
- added client/cmdrelay.c and client/cmdrelay.h
